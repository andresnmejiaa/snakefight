# snakefight
old timey game built using the PyGame module.



abstracting from the book "Making Games With PyGame," I wrote a quick "snake" and "board" class to make the game settings more versatile.

After that, I added another snake, and changed the rules of snake, so that you can go through the  walls, go through your own body, 
but you die if your head touches the body of the other snake. 

The game is simple, the code is simple. Enjoy!
